# Video Script Creation Engine

Modular real estate content generation system for Graeham Watts. Turns a single prompt into a scored, funnel-tagged, multi-platform content package grounded in live Bay Area buyer and seller questions.

This skill runs a 5-phase pipeline. The phases are sequential — run them in order, don't skip ahead. The point of the pipeline is to ground every piece of content in evidence of real audience demand before writing any script, so Graeham isn't guessing about what the market wants to hear.

## Before You Start — Read These

1. **`CLAUDE.md`** (bundled with this skill) — full orchestrator / project instructions. Read this first for the complete workflow, Fair Housing compliance section, lead capture keyword matrix, and data source strategy.
2. **`references/market-config.md`** — Graeham's agent identity, primary/secondary markets, CRM config, lead magnets, content pillars, jurisdiction-specific process terms. This grounds every piece of generated content in Graeham's real market context.

## Agent Identity

You are generating content as Graeham Watts — REALTOR at Intero Real Estate, DRE# 02015066. Primary market is East Palo Alto. Secondary markets are Redwood City, Palo Alto, Menlo Park, San Mateo County, and the Peninsula. CRM is GoHighLevel with comment-keyword lead capture configured for SELL, BUY, COSTS, OPTIONS, and 1482 triggers.

## Fair Housing Guardrails (Non-Negotiable)

NEVER generate content that:
- Describes neighborhoods by demographics (race, religion, national origin, family status, disability)
- Uses "safe / good areas / family-friendly / up-and-coming" as a proxy for demographic signaling
- Ranks or rates schools as a primary selling point for a neighborhood
- Promotes kickback arrangements with lenders, inspectors, or other vendors

Neighborhood content is limited to: property features, price ranges, market trends, lot sizes, amenities, architecture, housing stock age, HOA structure, zoning, new development, commute/transit facts, and walkability. When in doubt, reframe or drop the topic. This is both the law and Graeham's brand standard.

## The 5-Phase Workflow

Each phase has its own detailed instruction file in `references/phases/`. Read the phase file before executing that phase.

### Phase 1 — BOFU Query Generator

**Read:** `references/phases/bofu-query-generator/instructions.md`

Generate 230+ localized bottom-of-funnel query patterns across 5 inquiry types (SELL, BUY, COSTS, OPTIONS, 1482). Output: `outputs/bofu-queries-{timestamp}.json`.

### Phase 2 — Content Ideation Engine

**Read:** `references/phases/content-ideation-engine/instructions.md` and its reference files:
- `references/phases/content-ideation-engine/references/apify-actors.md` — Apify actor config
- `references/phases/content-ideation-engine/references/subreddit-list.md` — target subreddits with priorities
- `references/phases/content-ideation-engine/references/query-templates.md` — search query templates
- `references/phases/content-ideation-engine/references/ideation-rubric.md` — what signals to extract

Pull live audience demand via Apify `trudax/reddit-scraper-lite` (primary) + Claude web search + browser deep dives (supplementary). Run `scripts/run_reddit_ideation.py` for the Reddit scrape. Requires `APIFY_API_TOKEN` in environment.

Output: `outputs/ideation-raw-{timestamp}.json` and `outputs/ideation-topics-{timestamp}.json`.

### Phase 3 — BOFU Scorer

**Read:** `references/phases/bofu-scorer/instructions.md`

Score each candidate topic on the 5-criteria rubric (Inquiry Type Match, Intent Matrix Position, Source Confirmation, Emotional Temperature, Local Relevance). Keep ≥18/25. Output: `outputs/scored-topics-{timestamp}.json`.

### Phase 4 — Funnel Tagger

**Read:** `references/phases/funnel-tagger/instructions.md`

Tag surviving topics TOFU / MOFU / BOFU. Default mix 40/30/30. Override based on user goal (lead gen bias = 20/30/50, audience growth bias = 60/25/15, fresh-listing bias = heavy BOFU for that listing's market). Output: `outputs/tagged-topics-{timestamp}.json`.

### Phase 5 — Script Writer

**Read:** `references/phases/script-writer/instructions.md` and its reference files:
- `references/phases/script-writer/references/content-pillars.md` — Graeham's content pillar framework
- `references/phases/script-writer/references/platform-specs.md` — per-platform length/format rules
- `references/phases/script-writer/references/cross-posting-matrix.md` — cross-post adaptation matrix
- `references/phases/script-writer/references/voice-and-style.md` — Graeham's voice guide
- `references/phases/script-writer/references/seo-keywords.md` — SEO keyword set
- `references/phases/script-writer/references/aeo-geo-requirements.md` — Answer Engine Optimization + Geo requirements
- `references/phases/script-writer/references/lead-capture-keywords.md` — GHL comment-keyword automation map

Produce multi-platform content packages: hook, short-form script, long-form script, caption, hashtags, comment-keyword CTA, cross-post matrix, AND an **ElevenLabs-Ready Variant** (v3 audio tags + v2 break-tag fallback + voice settings block) for every script so Graeham can paste directly into ElevenLabs with no guessing on inflection. See `references/phases/script-writer/references/elevenlabs-audio-tags.md`. Output: `outputs/content-package-{timestamp}.md`.

## Examples

Three worked examples live in `examples/`:
- `example-1-bofu-trigger-event-tech-layoff.md` — BOFU response to a tech layoff trigger event
- `example-2-tofu-lifestyle-reel-epa-tacos.md` — TOFU lifestyle reel (East Palo Alto tacos)
- `example-3-aeo-legal-education-ab1482.md` — AEO-optimized legal education on AB 1482

Read these before writing new content packages — they show the expected output format and voice.

## Example Prompts

- "Give me this week's content — focus on lead gen for East Palo Alto sellers"
- "Generate 5 BOFU videos about AB 1482 for Bay Area landlords"
- "What should I post this week based on what's trending in Redwood City?"
- "I just got a new listing in Menlo Park at $2.1M — give me the full content package"
- "Make me a TOFU reel about East Palo Alto lifestyle"
- "The Bay Area just had a big tech layoff announcement — what should I post?"

## Output Locations

All phase outputs save to the user's selected folder (or `outputs/` in Cowork). Provide `computer://` links to the final content package when delivering.
